    <h2>Why should I join FTC?</h2>

    <p class="text-center md:m-auto md:w-1/2">
      <strong class="text-bold">Because its fun, of course!</strong> There are also
      a bunch of different things you can do in the team other than just programming
      and building. Not only that, but <strong class="text-bold"
        >you don't need any experience!</strong
      > This is a learning experience, and you'll probably learn a lot—I don't expect
      many of you to have experience either, if I'm being honest. It can also help
      you on college applications, or learn something useful for your future career.
    </p>

    <h2>Team Roles</h2>

    <p class="text-center md:m-auto md:w-1/2">
      I want to make a more in-depth breakdown of the different roles. Right now
      I don't really have the time, so take <a
        class="link link-primary"
        href="ftc-possible-roles.pdf"
      >
        a look at this PDF for a bare-bones description of roles.
      </a> This isn't exactly an exhaustive list, and if there's something you'd
      prefer to do that isn't on that list, just say so.
